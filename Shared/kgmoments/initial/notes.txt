Moment based estimation of stochastic Kronecker graph parameters
================================================================

These experiments relate to a paper by Art Owen on 
how to estimate the parameters of a stochastic Kronecker
graph by fitting graph moment functions.

I originally worked on these experiments in 2009 (02-03, to be
precise).  I'm now working a bit on extending them for
Art's paper.  I guess this would be sent to WAW2011 at 
Emory. (Ideally)

So I'm starting with the old codes from 2009-02-03.  
Summary of codes:

:`rmat.m`: rmat code from John Gilbert, modified by me for
  the difference in the types of parameters
:`rmat.m`: rmat code from John Gilbert, which uses noise
  in the parameters at each level.  (However, there is only
  one set of noise used for the parameters, not continuous
  noise as in Tammy's case.)
    

Summary of todos:

1) Stochastic Kronecker generation:
-- "ball-dropping" aka Gilbert 
-- "ball-dropping with noise" aka Kolda
-- "exact coin-flipping"

2) Find a set of graphs to fit:

-- wb-cs.stanford
-- itdk0304
-- hep-th (Leskovec)
-- as20 (Leskovec)
-- Gnutella (Leskovec)
-- traces-networkA
-- wikipedia
-- uk-union
-- twitter

3) Fitting procedures

grid-search
fmincon
scipy optimize
