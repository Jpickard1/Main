1. Copy_of_mouse 44_fed_fasted_refed traces: a csv file with data from the mouse feeding experiemtn. This file was sent to Joshua from Can Chen, and the file was modified to remove column headers to make it easier to load into MATLAB. The activity of 21 neurons (columns) is monitored throughout time (rows).
2. keggCellCycleGenes.csv: a csv file containing the names of the genes included in the KEGG cell cycle pathway. The code to generate this table is available at: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ng8Ahn0Do2dtiDzHaQZPHmt-GEXuP31q?usp=sharing
3. Hafiz_ICASSP_HiC_RNAseq_data.zip: This contains time series data emailed to by by Sijia. The file is too large to push, so it is included in the .gitignore file.
