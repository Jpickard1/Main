function [network] = small_world_network(V)
%SMALL_WORLD_NETWORK: This function generates a small world network. A
%   small world network is a network where most nodes are not neighbors,
%   but nodes with common neighbors are more likely to become neighbors. In
%   these networks, the average distance between any 2 nodes it
%   proportional to the Log of the number of nodes in the network.
