% Description: This function computes a similarity matrix between each
% vertex in a network. It accepts and adjacency matrix as well as a
% parameter for which local similarity score should be used. These scores
% are defined in the paper: "Link prediction in complex networks: A survey"
% and currently available ones include:
%  - 'K': Katz
%  - 'ACT': Average Commute Time
