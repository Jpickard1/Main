# Uncovering Missing Links with Cold Ends
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TsXGWMqqt5euCtxnEQBodo3FM74gyvzO/view

This subdirectory contains code to reproduce the methods and select
experiments from the paper Uncovering Missing Links with Cold Ends by Zhu, 
Lu, Zhang, Zhou. The paper explores a series of similarity metrics between
vertices as a means of predicting missing edges in a network. Specifically,
the paper is interested in the similarity metrics that perform best for
predicting missing links associated with unpopular vertices. This type of
missing data is known as the cold end problem.

The code for the popularity scores will be in this subdirectory. All code
for the similarity different indices is locaded in:
MissingData/Code/local_similarity
