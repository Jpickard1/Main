# Evaluation

This directory is used to evaluate the quality of algorithms intended for imputing
missing data. The goal will be to build out this directory, but AUC will be the
initial and primary evaluation metric as that is what is commonly used as a
benchmark.

This directory should be used in conjunction with the Edge Removal directory. In
Edge Removal, a network is input, and a set of known edges and unknown edges are
produced. The known, unknown, and predicted network must all be supplied to use
this code.
