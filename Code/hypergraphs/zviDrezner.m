% ZVI DREZNER
%   This function computes the multiway relationship between random
%   variables of data according to the formula given by Zvi Drezner in the
%   paper: "Multirelation â€” a correlation among more than two variables"
%
%   data: m x n matrix with m measurements on n random variables
