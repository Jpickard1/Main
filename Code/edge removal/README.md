# Edge Removal

This subdirectory contains code to remove edges from a network in a semi-intelligent
way. These methods come from the paper "Finding missing edges and communities
in incomplete networks" by Yan and Gregory. They posit there are 4 reasons
edges are missing in data:

1. Random: Edges are randomly missing uniformly throughout the data
2. Snowball Effect: Due to a networks size, only a sample of data is collected typically through a BFS or random walk style algorith. As a result, edges are missing at the frontier of the sampled data.
3. Cold Ends: Vertices with low degrees are more likely to have missing edges. This is implemented by removing edges at vertices with minimal degree that are not bridges.
4. Right Censoring: Edges are missing because the degree of a vertex is bounded. This is implemented by removing edges at vertices with maximal degrees, but no bounding constraint is given.

This directory contains functions to remove edges according to each of the
above schemes. All functions assume that a complete network is passed to them
and they return 2 objects: a network with the known edges accrding to one of
the above schemes and a network with all edges that are unknown.

All edge removal algorithms are parameterized only by the percent of edges to be removed.

WARNING: The code in this directory is currently set for unweighted, undirected
networks only.
