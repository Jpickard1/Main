# MissingData

This repository contains code, data, and related research for the Missing
Data project. The focus of this project is to understand and fill in
areas of a data set that likely contain misisng information. This problem
is being approached from both the graph and hypergraph perspective, and has
applications in developing a mapping between Hi-C (pairwise) and Pore-C
(multiway) genome sequencing.
