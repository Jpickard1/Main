This repository is refactored to a general purpose workspace for smaller projects that
do not yet require their own repository.

This repository contains code, data, and related research for the Missing
Data project. The focus of this project is to understand and fill in
areas of a data set that likely contain missing information. This problem
is being approached from both the graph and hypergraph perspective, and has
applications in developing a mapping between Hi-C (pairwise) and Pore-C
(multiway) genome sequencing.
