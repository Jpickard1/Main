%% Test Graph Alignment
%
%   Graph alignment is a critical task for implementing the kronfit
%   algorithm. This file serves to test the functions responsible for this
%   implementation.

%% Test 1
%   Idea: does the algorithm work to correctly align 2 graphs where I know
%   the alignment. We test this with the adjacency matrix that is the 4x4 
%   antidiagonal matrix. The set of node permutations that are ''correct''
%   for such a matrix is all pairs (i, n-i) when there are i vertices for
%   i=1...n. The following test ensures that graphs of this form are
%   aligned correctly.

kronExp = 3;
theta = [0.1 0.9;
         0.9 0.1];
P = theta;
for i=1:kronExp
    P = kron(theta,P);
end
A = (P > 0.5);
p = firstPermutation(A, theta, 1000);
a = length(unique(sum([p; flip(p)],1)));
assert(a == 1);

%% Test 2
%   Idea: watch how the graph becomes aligned over the course of execution

kronExp = 3;
eps = 0.1;
theta = [1 1 1;
         0 1 0
         1 0 1];
theta = theta - eps; theta(theta < 0) = eps;

P = theta;
for i=1:kronExp
    P = kron(theta,P);
end
A = (P > 0.25);
p = firstPermutation(A, theta, 100000);
